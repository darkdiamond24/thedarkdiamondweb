                <p>Welcome to my portfolio. This is where I will showcase my work and projects. You can also check out my work on my <a href="https://github.com/darkdiamond24" target="_blank">Github.</a></p>
                <h2>Quote generator Kotlin script</h2>
                <p>I made a Kotlin script that generates random quotes. It uses class and object instances as well as Boolean statements. I used the when statement. There are 50 different possible quotes which are printed to the console.</p>
                <p>Depending on the random number generated, the corresponding println statement for that number will be printed to the console. The script can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/darkdiamond24/QuoteGenerator" target="_blank">Github</a>. I will also have the script below so you can see and try out the script yourself.</p>
