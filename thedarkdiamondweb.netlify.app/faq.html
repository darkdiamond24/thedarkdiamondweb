        <h2>What are the article references for?</h2>
        <p>The article references are so that you can much more easily find each article. Each article has its own article reference so that they can be easily found. You can much more easily go to any article you may want to go to by simply using the article references. If you make an enquiry to me regarding one(or more) of the articles, you can use the article reference(s) of the article(s). I do plan to make this article reference system more efficient in the future.</p>
        <h2>Why does the <a href="Register-Form.html">e-mail list</a> only have 100 spots.</h2>
        <p>I have the e-mail list with 100 spots because I do not expect the amount of people subscribed to the e-mail list to be more than 100. However, if more than 100 people subscribe to the e-mail list, I will likely improve it and not have it with a maximum number of spots for it. That way, many more people can subscribe to the e-mail list.</p>
        <h2>What happens after I submit the form for the e-mail list?</h2>
        <p>After the form to subscribe to the e-mail list is submitted, I will receive it on my end. I check all form submissions every Friday(sometimes I may check them sooner depending on my schedule). Whenever the next Friday is for you, after I check your submission and add you to the e-mail list, you will receive an e-mail to confirm that you will be receiving e-mail updates every Friday.</p>
        <h2>What if I change my mind and don't want to be subscribed to the e-mail list anymore?</h2>
        <p>If you don't want to be subscribed to the e-mail list anymore, you can email me about it, or you can reply to the confirmation email or any of the blog email updates that are sent. If I don't respond right away, just know that it will take up to 3 days for me to remove you from the email list if I'm somehow so busy that I'm unable to see my emails. However, it will usually take less than a day.</p>
        <h2>What will happen after I am removed from the email list?</h2>
        <p>After you are removed from the email list, the information you input into the form(your name and email) will be removed from my email list and no record of it will be kept. You won't recieve email updates anymore and you will recieve an email letting you know that you have been removed from the email list. If you would like to resubscribe, you can just submit the form again.</p>
        <h2>What happens when the website (or the content) has to be down for reasons such as maitenance?</h2>
        <p>When the website is down for maitenance, I will typically put a maitenance page to replace the site's typical content. This is usually for reasons such as restructuring the site or even server-related things like hosting. This, however will not be likely to be an issue, but if there is, don't worry as I will email all members of my email list and you can feel free to email me for any questions regarding the site.</p>
        <h2>What was used to make this website?</h2>
        <p>I wrote the website using HTML and CSS, as that's all I really need for the website as of writing this. I may add some javascript to it in the future, but it won't be a mandatory part of the website for it to function, as I am aware some people don't allow javascript in their browser due to the possible security risk, so I don't plan to make javascript a fundamenal component of this site because of this fact. I also don't want to as I do not want this website to have any unnecessary stuff that will just cause an inconvenience.</p>
        <h2>How often is the website updated?</h2>
        <p>I try to typically update the website on a weekly basis. As I try to add new content to it and stuff like that as I have a blog on this website, which I try to do blog posts on every week. There are however, particular times when I may not be able to or just don't have the time to update the website. However, I do try to update the website when I can.</p>
       <h2>Is the last time the date was updated the same as when it was published?</h2>
       <p>Usually it is. However, it's not always. As sometimes I may just update the site but I'll end up publishing the changes to the site a different day. So the last time I updated the site means that was the last time that it was updated. It does not necessarily mean the day it was published. However, majority of the time, the site's changes are published after the changes are made</p>
