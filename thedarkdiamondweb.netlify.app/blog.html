I made this website to showcase myself and really showcase different things. I am going to do a road map. And much more than that! My main part of the road map will be in my career and programming, but it will be so much more!</p>
                    <p>This blog post was pretty short, but I will be making more blog posts, especially involving the road map!</p>

                    <section>
                        <p>It has really only been maybe a few days since I made this website. However, I have been consistently making changes to this website. I do plan to be adding many more changes and improvements to this website. If you have any suggestions for this website such as improvements, etc. You can feel free to e-mail me. My e-mail is in <a href="Contact.html">contact.</a></p>
                        <p>With the changes and improvements made to this website, here are some of the improvements and changes that have been made:
                          <ul>
                            <li>Added different pages such as the blog, portfolio, etc.</li>
                            <li>Added article references to reference the different articles on this blog as well as easily being able to go to/find different articles.</li>
                            <li>On the homepage, a bit of text that says the last time the website was updated.</li>
                            <li>A navigation menu to navigate through the website easily.</li>
                          </ul></p>
                          <p>I will also be adding more to this website and making more changes such as:
                            <ul>
                              <li>Adding to the <a href="Portfolio.html">Portfolio</a></li>
                              <li>Adding a featured section to the home page and possibly even the blog</li>
                              <li>Improving accesibility and making the website better and more appealing for users</li>
                              <li>Creating a form where users can submit to be subscribed to the blog newsletter(might use google forms or I will make my own form for this website)</li>
                              </ul>
                              <p>Hopefully most of these changes will be implemented by the time the next weekly update on this blog is posted.</p>
                              <p>A reminder that if you would like to receive e-mails for the blog straight in your inbox you can send me an email to be part of the blog e-mail list.

                  </p>

                  <p>Well, it's been a fairly good while, hasn't it? I forgot to post the weekly update on Friday as I was pretty busy, but I may as well just post the weekly update now.</p>
                  <p>I have implemented several different improvements and changes to the website. The main improvements and changes I have added to the website were:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Redesigned the website. I've decided to give the website a black background and have white be the color for other elements such as the text and divider. I find that this is a simplistic and modern look for the website. However, this design may be changed later on but for now I will stick with the current design.</li>
                      <li>Created a form for people to subscribe to the e-mail list. Users can now just enter in their name and e-mail and they will receive e-mail updates. Which will be much easier for me to manage. If you would like to sign up to the e-mail list, you can go the registration form <a href="Register-Form.html">here</a>.</li>
                      <li>Created a <a href="FAQ.html">FAQ</a> for the website. It is only recent and I will be adding more to the FAQ.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                </section>
                <section>
                  <p>I will be adding more changes soon to the website as well. Such as:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Adding more to the <b>FAQ</b>.</li>
                      <li>Improving usability and accessibility for the website.</li>
                      <li>Improving the registration form for the e-mail list.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                  <p>I hope to make the above changes to improve the website by the time the next weekly update is posted.</p>
                  <p>If you would like to subscribe to the <a href="Register-Form.html">e-mail list</a> you can subscribe via the <a href="Register-Form.html">registration form</a>. I will also put a button below go to the form to subscribe to the e-mail list if you would like to subscribe to the e-mail list.</p>

              <article>
                <p>It has been a pretty good while since I have checked up on my website. Mostly since I have been pretty busy. However, now I will continue to work on this website.</p>
                <p>There haven't really been that many new updates on this website. I have fixed the navbar so it isn't going to be as bad on mobile now, although in my opinion, the nav bar is going to need a good bit of improvement, I will try to fix that at some point but for now, I think I will just leave it be. </p>
                <p>Now a thing I'm planning to add to every weekly update is what I have done in that week and my goals, etc. Kinda like a blog showcasing what I've done and stuff.</p>
                <p>So this week I have been learning to code more. Mostly in Kotlin as well as android app development.</p>
                <p>That's this week's weekly update.</p>

              <h2 id="Article5-roadmap2">Roadmap Update</h2>
              <p>Article reference: <b>Article5-roadmap2</b></p>
              <p>Publish date: <b>11th April 2023</b></p>
              <p>So I haven't really done any sort of update on my 'Road map'. Now, to start off, what do I mean by my roadmap? The roadmap will basically just be me documenting my journey in programming and really any sort of career and work related stuff. Any projects I may document here in my roadmap are likely to end up being put on my <a href="Portfolio.html">portfolio</a> as my portfolio is where I show a lot of the work I do. However, it's also likely that I'll also put the work I do on my <a href="https://github.com/darkdiamond24">Github</a>. Anyways, as I was saying, this roadmap is basically going to be me documenting my journey, and that's not going to only be in programming. As it could be in any other career and work sort of stuff I may document here. For example, I may document progress in learning stuff about IT and more!</p>
              <p>So I'm going to just document what I did related to my roadmap since my last roadmap blog post. I am NOT going to really discuss any updates related to this website. I discuss that in the weekly update blog posts.</p>
              <p>Since my last blog post, I have been learning a good bit of the Kotlin programming language. I am currently learning on the Android Basics with Kotlin course by Android. I plan to do the Compose course afterwards.</p>
                <p>As of now, here are the following programming languages I am learning:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Kotlin</li>
                  <li>Python</li>
                  <li>JavaScript</li>
                  <ins><li>BASH</li></ins>
                </ol>
                <p>I am mostly going to have my roadmap with a focus on IT and programming. I do plan to give more updates on my roadmap. I also plan to learn more programming languages and other stuff. I am also going to try to practice my skills more and will also try to gain certifications for them, such as programming on freecodecamp.org.</p>
                <p>That basically ends this roadmap update. I will be posting the weekly update on Friday.</p>
                <p>Thank you for reading this blog post!</p>

                <article>
                  <p>Well, it's been again a real while since I have last made a blog post here on my website. Mostly because I've been caught up with school and also with other stuff. I've been learning a good bit about IT and I'm actually taking a Computer Science course to better broaden my skills.</p>
                  <p>I haven't added anything to this website since the last blog post. I think the website is good enough for now since I'm happy enough with the simple design and UI of the website, of course it isn't the best in the world but I'll instead make changes whenever. That way, I can put more focus to use this website for my blog and portfolio.</p>
                  <p>So for maybe a little personal update, I've been doing a good bit more of online learning, learning about IT and programming and other stuff. I recenly finished reading the book <b>A brief history of time</b> by Stephen Hawking. It was a great book and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in  anything related to physics, astrophysics and cosmplogy.</p>
                  <p>So that sums up this week's weekly update. I will be making a roadmap blog post at some point. Anyways, I hope you enjoyed reading this blog post.</p>

                <article>
                  <p>This week hasn't had too much going on. I have been doing a lot of learning and stuff like that. Especially in IT and programming.</p>
                  <p>I recently enrolled in CS50p on edX. It's a harvard online course on python. I'm going to continue on that course since I am trying to learn more python as well as more stuff like IT and whatever else. I will be putting updates on this in my roadmap blog posts, so if you would like to get updates on that, you can subscribe to the <a href="Register-Form.html" target="_blank">Email list</a> to get email updates regarding the blog in your inbox.</p>
                  <p>I also have exams starting in maybe a few weeks. I'm going to try and study for them and I'm not really sure what I'll do during the summer. I'll probably try and study more as well as improving and adding skills to my skillset. I will likely also try to do more online learning and stuff like that.</p>
                  <p>That pretty much sums up this week, since not that muh really happened and I haven't really made any changes to the website.</p>

                  <p>It's been a while since the last roadmap update. Well anyways I'm going to give this roadmap update.</p>
                  <p>I have mostly been learning stuff in regards to cybersecurity and IT as well as in programming. I'm currently doing the CompTIA IT Fundamentals course on <a href="https://itpro.tv" target="_blank">itpro.tv</a>. And for those wondering, I probably won't take the IT Fundamentals exam. I'm doing that course to start off my career and to improve and add to my skillset. However, I may actually take the exam to get the certification at some point.</p>
                  <p>I have also begun to do a lot more IT and cybersecurity training and also in programming. I'm planning to get the Responsive web design certification on <a href="freecodecamp.org" target_blank>freecodecamp.org</a>. Since I'll be able to gain skills in web development as well as being able to get the certification which I can then use as proof for my skills.</p>
                  <p>That has really been a good portion of my roadmap or at least what I plan to do for now. I will also need to balance it with school and be able to plan out my career so that hopefully in the future, I can be able to achieve my goals.</p>
                  <p>I also plan to start working on different projects and doing different work to put on my portfolio. I'll let you know anything else in my next roadmap blog post. If you would like to work on any projects with me, feel free to email me.</p>
                  <p>Anyways, I hope you enjoyed reading this blog post, and feel free to subscribe to the <a href="Register-Form.html">email list</a> if you would like to receive weekly blog updates and haven't subscribed already.

                <article>
                  <p>So this week I haven't really added much of anything to this webite and nothing new really happened for me. Exams are starting for me soon. Maybe in a couple of weeks, so I'm planning to study for the exams, as I'll be in 3rd year next year (That's basically just 9th grade). In 3rd year, I will also have the Junior Cert (an important state exam), so I am planning to put more time and effort into studying.</p>
                  <p>However, the good thing is after my current exams are over, I'll summer break to prepare and also to give myself time to relax. I'll also have the time to do do my own learning and other stuff in my free time, such as programming. However, in general, I'd say it isn't too big to stress over, since I have a lot of time to prepare and I'll have a lot of time in 3rd year to study for the junior cert.</p>
                  <p>For now, I plan to start studying for my exams as of now, and during summer break I'll start studying for the junior cert and I'll also study and prepare for 3rd year (basically by simply just studying and learning the stuff I learned in 2nd year and had on my 2nd year exams as well as the topics that we may start learning in 3rd year).</p>
                  <p>That was really all I did this week. Mostly just studying for my upcoming exams.</p>
                  <p>Anyways, I hope you enjoyed reading this blog post.</p>

                    <p>Hello, it's been a <b>long</b> time since I have updated this website or put a new article here on the blog, and I am sorry for that (although you probably don't care). My computer broke and I only got my new one today, but don't you worry, because I have some plans that I am hoping to get started on now that I have my computer.</p>
                    <p>My main plans will probably be to update the featured page, add a small change to the <a href="register-form.html">email list registration form</a>. And I also plan to work on more projects, learn to code more, as it's beem a long time since I've written some code, so the best way to get that practice is to get my hands on the keyboard and to work on something.</p>
                    <p>I will list the main changes I'm planning to add below:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Add stuff to the featured page</li>
                      <li>Update the updated text at the homepage now that I've updated the site</li>
                      <li>Add a small tweak to the Registration form</li>
                      <li>Put in more blog posts and give an email update to current email subscribers this Friday</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Thank you for reading this blog post. I will be keeping you updated. Anyways feel free to register your email to the email list if you want to receive email updates every Friday!</p>

                  <p>Hello, since I have started to do stuff on this website again since yesterday, today may as well be a good day for another <b>roadmap update</b>!</p>
                  <p>Well, since I didn't have a computer which I could use for the past few months that I was inactive, it can be seen that I haven't had much convenience for programming, and I guess procrasination also had a role to play. However, there are some things that did happen during this fairly long time period.</p>
                  <p>I have been using termux, which is basically a Linux terminal that can be used on mobile. I used it to practice a bit of coding and I used IRC through irssi there. I also learned on khan academy and YouTube. I learned a good bit of physics and philosophy as those are pretty big interests of mine.</p>
                 <p>That was basically it. So, for now my plans will be to learn more. For now, I'll do web development, android app development, Python, and IT, such as networking, cybersecurity, etc. As 2024, is nearing, I'll be starting a daily coding and learning challenge, where I code every day and learn and explain my knowledge, which I hope this blog will help with. Plus, my portfolio needs some filling up. If you are interested, you can feel free to email me at thedarkdiamond24@gmail.com.</p>
                 <p>Anyways, I hope you enjoyed reading this blog post. If you have any questions, feel free to email me.</p>

                  <p>Hello. It's been a few days since my last blog post. However, I have made a good few changes on this website and I have more plans as well for the future.</p>
                  Since my last blog post, I have made the <b>following changes: </b><ol>
                    <li>I changed and rewrote the <a href="about.html">about</a></li> page
                    <li>I added the <b>Featured</b> heading on the <a href="index.html">homepage</a>, so now I will be putting featured content there as I think it will help people visiting this site to find pages they may want to check out</li>
                    <li>I rewrote the <a href="index.html">homepage</a></li>
                    <li>I changed the website font to <b>Monospace</b></li>
                    <li>I set up <b>Google analytics</b> for this website so I can now know what kind of users visit my website</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>This is mainly what I added to the website. I will also be stopping the <b>Roadmap Updates</b> blog posts until the start of 2024. I will be changing the name to <b>diary</b>, or some other kind of name for it. The reason I did this, is because I want those blog posts to kind of be like where I talk about my progression in terms of career, personal growth, etc. It will kind of be something for me to look back on in the future. So, the roadmap updates will be postponed until <b>1st January 2023</b>.</p>
                  <p>I have also been spending more time on learning programming, although I have exams coming up, so I may not be able to learn as much until my exams finish. I will be posting weekly updates every Friday, and next year I will also begin posting the diary blog posts every Sunday.</p>
                  <p>Anyways, I hope you enjoyed reading this blog post. If you haven't already, you can feel free to subscribe to the <a href="register-form.html">E-mail list</a> to receive e-mail updates from the blog every Friday.</p>

                 <article>
                  <p>Hello, it's been a few days since the last weekly update. I was very busy yesterday, so I didn't really have the time to post the weekly update yesterday. However, after my exams I will have Winter holidays, so I'll have more time to work on this website and I can learn and practice more coding and tech stuff once my exams end.</p>
                  <p>Since my last weekly update, I have not really added anything new to the website. However, I do have some plans for the website.</p>
                  <p>I am thinking to rewerite the CSS of this website and also the layout and style on this website. This means I may end up putting a maintenance page until I have updated the CSS of the website. But it is going to be likely that I will not do this. The main reason that I will be rewriting the CSS is to improve the style and efficiency of this website. I also have not updated the CSS since the site's creation.</p>
                  <p>And I also have a little something I'm working on. It's an idea for now, but the idea in particular is for a new website I may develop. You may find out about what it is as I may mention it on here soon, so stay tuned to the blog, or if you're subscribed to the <a href="register-form.html">email list</a>, you do not have to worry as you will know as long as you read the email updates.</p>
                  <p>Before I end this blog post, if you haven't already, please feel free to subscribe to the <a href="register-form.html">e-mail list</a> to receive email updates every Friday. There are 99 spots available, so feel free to subscribe to the email list if you want.</p>
                  <a href="register-form.html"><button>Subscribe to the email list</button></a>
                  <p>There isn't really anything else for me to talk about, so this is the end of this blog post.</p>

                <article>
                  <p>Hello again. With the end of the year being a lot closer, I won't publish any more blog posts until <b>1st of January 2024</b>. I will be doing this because there won't really be much for me to work on or really discuss until then. And I see it as pointless to be making blog posts about how I did not do anything interesting at all.</p>
                  <p>Another good thing as well is that my last exam is on Monday, so that is also another reason I'm going to not do anymore blog posts until 2024. As until then, I want to give myself some time to relax as this year has been craxy and exhausting.</p>
                  <p>I do actually have a few ideas for this website for 2024. I plan to use these weekly updates as a place to put some other stuff. For example, I plan to add some stuff in the weekly updates where I discuss stuff like random ideas, topics and stuff I learn. I am also thinking to add a few other updates in 2024.</p>
                  <p>So, that has been all for this week's update. If you haven't already, feel free to subscribe to the <a href="register-form.html">E-mail list</a>.

                  <p>I was planning to post the yearly update yesterday, but I decided to just do it today as today is the first day of 2024. So to whoever is reading this blog post, Happy New Year!</p>
                  <p>In my opinion, this was not the best of years. This year I am planning on putting more time and learning and whatnot. A lot of interesting things have also happened during this year.</p>
                  <p>I am going to be continuing the weekly updates again and I will be doing the diary blog posts starting from this Sunday. I will be doing the weekly updates again starting on Friday.</p>
                  <p>I have a lot planned for 2024, so to everyone reading this, make this year matter!</p>
                  <p>I don't really have much else to discuss, so feel free to subscribe to the email list if you would like to.</p>

                <article>
                <p>Hello, so to start off, sorry for the lesser blog posts recently. I have been busy and kind of got pretty lazy so I ended up putting off the work on this website, but I am getting back to doing what I was previously doing. I also don't really have much to do right now, so I may as well make this blog post.</p>
                <p>I am currently going to be learning more programming and I am going to need to brush up on web development(which I will likely do using freecodecamp) as well as learn more android app development and I will work on my other skills such as my IT skills as, if you didn't know, I am actually into security/cybersecurity as well as networking and I am getting into penetration testing too.</p>
                <p>So my fields of interest comprises of 2 areas: programming and IT. There is a lot of parts that overlap, as both areas have skills and uses that help for the other area. So although in terms of what to focus on, they are kind of seperate, they cam really just be merged together. As both of these fields involve a lot of the other field.</p>
                <p>I am also going to be brushing up on Computer Science and am doimg the OSSU Computer Science curriculum. It's basically an entire Computer Science degree but more self-taught and is all free. I am doing it starting now so by he time I go to college(I realy hope I can do computer Science in college), I will have a lot of knowledge and improved skill in computer science and programming. This will also help me to see all the potential areas I am interested in.</p>
                <p>I am also doing the same for IT. As I am doing an IT roadmap as well. Which involves me learning in the many IT areas. I am also going to practice my skills and stuff like that.</p>
                <p>As I am doing the OSSU CS curriculum, I think it's a good idea that I brush up and improve my mathematical knowledge and skills as it's a big part of the field of technology and it will likely prove to be better if I do the prerequisites, which I will do along the way while I am also doing the OSSU CS curriculum.</p>
                <p>So that has been my journal update for this week. I will post the weekly update on Saturday and I will post the jounal update on the next Sunday.</p>
                </article>

                <article>
                  <p>Hello, it's been a while since I made my last blog post. School got more tiresome and I got a bit lazy so that's the main reason. But I'm going to continue making the blog posts now and improving this website I guess.</p>
                  <p>So far, I haven't done much updates on this website as well, I didn't really bother. However, I do have plans for improving this website, which i will hopefully do at some point.</p>
                  <p>Since there isn't much that I actually added on this website, I will just talk about stuff I did so far in the real world.</p>
                  <p>I have been learning more programming and I have been playing a lot of video games recently. I've also been learning a bit of cybersecurity and currently I am learning C and Assembly as well why shouldn't I. Plus, I am learning reverse engineering, or at least planning to. So there is no harm in me learning it. PLus, I can learn the lower level stuff in programming that is taken for granted at the higher level.</p>
                  <p>I have also been setting habits for learning and stuff. Basically, the habit I have set is to have 7 playlists(Learning 1, Learning 2, Learning 3, Learning 4, Learning 5, Learning 6 and learning 7) on YouTube which I put learning videos in. Then each day, on one of the learning playlists, I will watch at least 3 videos from it and I will use the shuffle feature on it. So far, the 1st 2 playlists are full, so I use the first 1 for Monday to Thursday and the 2nd one for Friday to Sunday. Each playlist has a limit of 5,000 videos so that means that once all the playlists are full, there will be a total of 35,000 videos. It's an interesting habit, so if you're interested in it, go ahead and try it out by making playlists, putting learning content in them, and then using the shuffle feature to watch videos in them. It helps to improve your attention span as you also have no control over which videos you get. I use it myself and it's actually a pretty good way for me to learn various stuff.</p>
                  <p>Other than that, I haven't done much else, so I'm going to end this blog post here. The <b>journal update</b> will be posted on Sunday.</p>
                  <p>Anyways, please feel free to subscribe to the <a href="register-form.html">e-mail list</a> and goodbye for now until I publish the next blog post.</p>

                    <p>Hello, looks like this time I actually followed through and decided to actually do this journal update. To be honest, I probably was pretty lazy these past 2 weeks due to school so I'm not sure how much I will have for this journal update.</p>
                    <p>I am continuing on doing the OSSU Computer Science curriculum as a general roadmap, but I actually plan to go at my own pace and learn stuff in a non-restrictive way but I'll use the curriculun as  a way to get me to learn more and whatnot. I am also going to learn more programming and cybersecurity stuff.</p>
                    <p>Recently I have gotten interesting in doing lower-level stuff and learning programming languages such as C and Assembly language. I am learning them purely for fun. I am also learning more Python and whatnot. The current programming languages I am planning on learning/improving on are:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Python</li>
                      <li>Kotlin</li>
                      <li>C</li>
                      <li>Assembly language</li>
                      <li>Web development markup languages such as CSS(and a bit of HTML but I know HTML pretty well)</li>
                      <li>BASH</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I am also planning on learning more IT/hacking stuff I guess(not the bad kind) such as reverse engineering and networking. I am planning to learn more and improve in the following areas:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Networking</li>
                      <li>Security/cybersecurity</li>
                      <li>Reverse engineering</li>
                      <li>Operating Systems</li>
                      <li>Linux and Linux CLI</li>
                      <li>Computer hardware and architecture</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I am also planning on learning more regarding Computer Science and other areas of interest.</p>
                    <p>Anyway, there isn't really much else for me to add here. I will do the next journal update on Sunday next week and I will do the weekly update on Saturday, so goodbye for now.</p>

                  <p>Hello it's been a while since I made my last blog post. Got pretty caught up, but I am goimg to try and get back on tracl and make sure I do my weekly blog posts. I have also decided to make a decision. I will ditch the roadmap/journal topic as well. It doesn't mean it'll be gone, but it will not have its own separate topic. Instead, it will be part of the weekly updates starting from next week. Which is why the journal update won't be done this week. This way, I can do a single blog post every week here. Which will provide me more flexibility and also I will at least have to post less blog posts so I think this change will probablu be good. I will make occasional other blog posts that may not fit into the weekly update and stuff, but generally, you should expect blog posts every week.</p>
                  <p>Anyway, apart from school, I've been learning more stuff about physics as it's one of the things I really enjoy(as well as Computer Science and science and technology in general I guess, and also philosophy). Other than that, I've been playing video games as well as chess(feel free to add me on chess.com. My username is thedarkdiamond24. I'm pretty bad but I'm proving so that's good).</p>
                  <p>I haven't got that much else to say. So for every weekly update on the email list, I will ask a question which members of the email list can answer by replying to the email. So if you would like to subscribe to the email list, feel free to subscribe <a href="register-form.html">here</a>. You will get emails from me for this blog post and can also interact, participate in discussions, surveys, etc.</p>
                  <p>Anyways, I will post my next weekly update next week and I will publish the email update sometime today or tomorrow. So I'll see you next week then.</p>

                    <p>it's Friday, so it's time I publish this week's weekly update. Good thing is that I only really need to publish one blog article per week at minimum so in these weekly updates I can basically put more effort into these blog posts. Although it does not guarantee that every single blog post will be of great quality because of school and other stuff, so some blog posts may be rushed. But I will try my best not to let that happen.</p>
                    <p>Anyway, so far this week has been pretty chill. I've been learning stuff about physics and computer science on YouTube and online for my free time. But I haven't really been able to go back to my original approach. As a result, things aren't exactly going as inteneded. So by next week, I am going to have things be fixed to go as intended. Stuff just messed all of that up I guess.</p>
                    <p>Another thing as well is that I am actually starting a discord community server(it's not the one on my socials page). I won't tell much about it yet until I grow the server a bit more. But so far, the server is doing decent.</p>
                    <p>I am also rewatching the moveies from the MCU up until EndGame, as after endgame Marvel of went downhill from there. I'll have holidays coming up soon after Monday so I'll have more free time to spare and can watch those movies.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, I haven't had the time to put into coding or IT. So I am going to try to work on that by changing up my habits to ensure I can practice and learn more programming and IT due to my actual habits. Making learning programming and IT a primary part of my routine, which will add up a lot over time.</p>
                    <p>I haven't got much else to say here, so I'll end this email here. For those subscribed to the email list, I will send the email update tomorrow.</p>
                    <p>Anyways, see you next week.</p>

                    <p>Hello it's been a while. I have been busy mostly with school. However, I am going to be working on programming again. I'm planning on learning Kotlin, Python and web development again to brush up and improve. As I've gotten pretty rusty as I haven't coded that much for a while. Which is why I am intending on getting things back on track and working on stuff again.</p>
                    <p>I've also been learning more about physics and science stuff this week. And I have also been working on my server. I am also going to edit the <a href="contact.html">contact</a> page to include my socials and stuff. I am going to use it as a replacement for my solo.to page as that way I don't need to bother with going to solo.to as well as editing the site. So I will have improved efficiency with this approach.</p>
                    <p>Now other than that stuff, I have some plans and things I'm working on. I do intend on writing about them here soon so be ready for that.</p>
                    <p>I don't have much else to write today for this week's weekly update, so I will end it here. If you haven't already, feel free to subscribe to the <a href="register-form.html">email list</a>. I will write the email update later on today. So if you are subscribed, check your inbox later on today.</p>
                    <p>Anyways, goodbye and I'll write my next blog post next week.</p>

                    <p>Hello everyone. For this weekly update, I don't really have as much things to discuss here, but I will try to discuss what I can here. As I do have a few things I do intend on discussing here. As it is currently Friday and I don't have much to do right now.</p>
                    <p>My dev team/company SpitFire Tech will be doing a rebrand. As well as change our focus and our business model. In the meantime until I get everytbing in order and get a new project idea, I will need to code more and improve my skill in programming as well as cybersecutity. I will continue doing my courses on the OSSU Computer Science curriculum. I will also learn Kotlin and more android app development and web development as well as Python. I can learn the math part along the way from sites such as khan academy as we well as good YouTube channels.  I will also learn Computer Science through the OSSU curriculum and other sources.</p>
                    <p>The OSSU curriculum will just be a general curriculum to improve my skill in programming and to find the fields I enjoy the most and pick up the big-picture knowledge due to it. I prefer to do things freely than structure. So although I will do the curriculum, I'll also learn some of the stuff at random, so I may be able to already know a good portion of the stuff.</p>
                    <p>Since it's also the weekend, I'm going to watch Thor: The Dark World today and I'll probably chill as well as code a bit.</p>
                    <p>Other than that, I do not have much else to discuss, so I will write my email update tomorrow and I'll see you all next week if you check next week. If you haven't already, feel free to subscribe to the <a href="register-form.html">email list</a>.</p>

                  <p>Publish date: <b>26th May 2024</b></p>
                  <p>Hello. It has been a while since I published an article here. I currently have exams so I'm quite busy with them. I've also been chilling and stuff. But today is Sunday so I decided to just publish the weekly update today.</p>
                  <p>I clearly haven't made any updates here as you can see. Apart from the typical stuff. I was considering a site redesign but I think the design of the site is good as of now. Especially since I made it minimalistic so it's simpler as that was my intention for the site's design. So I'll just keep the current design for now. Although, I do need to change the <a href="contact.html">contact</a> page since that page has barely been updated. Especially since I am going to use that page to replace my solo.to.</p>
                  <p>Seeing as my logo was made by me like 2 years ago at this point, I think I should make a new one, seeing how bad my current one is. And at this point, my current logo is quite old by my standards as I have had the same logo for around 2 years at this point.</p>
                  <p>Due to my exams, I haven't had much time to do more computer science or programming stuff. Although I'm going to have summer break after these exams so I'll probably code a lot more in that time. Especially since I'll probably have very little to do anyway during summer break. So I can probably work on more stuff and improve my programming skills.</p>
                  <p>I've also been working on that discord server I have, which I have mentioned before. I'll put that server over in <a href="contact.html">contact</a> when I change up that page.</p>
                  <p>I don't have much else to talk about here, so I'll end this article here.</p>

                    <p>Hi again. It's been a while. But the good thing is that my exams are finally over(I really hope I can just pass since I barely studied for my exams despite the fact that they were quite important ones). But since I now haven't got much else to do, I'll have more time to code as well as do stuff here on my website. Which is great since I really enjoy working on this website as it's one of the few things that helps keep me somewhat sane at this point.</p>
                    <p>As a started for my summer holidays, my ISP had some technical difficulties which resulted in an internet outage. I'm actually currently writing this article while my wifi still isn't working, so this website will likely be published at least an hour after I have already written this article. Just something interesting I would like to say in case you didn't know that. As although I may have finished the article on the <b>publish date</b> for this blog. The updates on this site and the new article wouldn't be publicly published until I deploy the updated version to the domain. That was just some pretty obvious stuff that I wanted to point out for you just in case you were interested.</p>
                    <p>This week I have also been playing video games quite a bit, so I hope I can play video games too as my way to enjoy the summer break more. In fact, today I've been a bit more hyperactive due to the fact I have no school for now. Because that's something I think everyone would be excited about. Especially this year since it has been quite stressful, but it's all good now since I can  do what I want for the summer break.</p>
                    <p>I'm also going to try and code more and learn more stuff as well, I really like learning stuff and coming up with ideas and thinking about stuff, so I may as well. I'll probably consider learning more and improving on web development as my skills in web development have actually gotten quite rusty. I'll also learn more Kotlin and Python. And I'm going to learn C soon and I'll probably learn more IT and cybersecurity stuff too since I enjoy that stuff.</p>
                    <p>I haven't really got much else to discuss here on this blog post, so if you want, feel free to subscribe to the <a href="register-form.html">email list</a> if you haven't already and are interested.</p>
                    <p>Anyways, I will write my next blog post next week as I have finished this weekly update.</p>

                    <p>Hi. It's been a while since I last published an article here. Sorry about that. I've been lazy and stuff but I'm going to continue again as I still enjoy working on this site as it's quite fun and I reall like to code. So I am back now.</p>
                    <p>I haven't really coded much since when I wrote my previous article. I'm going to try to code more however. I've also been playing quite a lot of video games. I also updated the <a href="contact.html">contact</a> page. I'll make more updates soon enough but here is a start.</p>
                    <p>Also, the <a href="https://discord.gg/nXHtF9qtvb" target="_blank">discord server</a> I told you about is on the contact page. And recently I have actually been researching and learning about ASD, or autism. As I find I relate to like 90% of the sympotoms for autism. I don't consider myself to actually have autism without an official diagnosis, but I wanted to learn more about it. Because I kind of already know I'm likely not that normal.</p>
                    <p>I haven't really done much else, so I think I should just end the blog post here. I'll see you next week.</p>
