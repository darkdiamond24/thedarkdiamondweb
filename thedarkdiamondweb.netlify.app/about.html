            <hr/>
            <main>
                <p>Hello, I'm The Dark Diamond. I'm currently 15 years old as of writing this. So, to add a bit more to this website, I decided to add this about page to tell some stuff about me and this website!</p>
                <h2 id="about me">About Me</h2>
                <p>So, instead of writing paragraphs for this about me section, I'll just make a little profile of myself below and that way it will hopefully be good enough for you. Although the bio part of it I'll try to put as much as I can.</p>
                <h3>Personal Profile</h3>

                <li>Name/alias: <b>The Dark Diamond</b></li>
                <li>Age: <b>15</b></li>
                <li>Country of origin: <b>Ireland</b></li>
                <li>Occupation: <b>Student</b></li>
                <li>Interests: <b>Programming, computer science, physics, IT, philosophy</b></li>
               <li>Hobbies: <b>Programming, learning, thinking about stuff, gaming</b></li>
               <li>Fields of specialisation: <b>Programming, IT/hacking</b></li>
               <li>Skills: <b>Programming, problem-solving(I consider myself okay or average), learning new information, thinking, coming up with ideas</b></li>
               <li>Experience: <b>I currently have 3 years of experience in programming, particularly in web development, as I've been doing it since I was 12.</b></li>
               <li>Bio: <b>I'm The Dark Diamond. A good bit of things about me are from the other parts of this profile. My MBTI is INTP-T (you can feel free to take the Myers-briggs personality test on <a href="https://16personalities.com" target="_blank">16personalities.com)</a>. I like to think of different things and ideas and have discussions about different topics.</b></li>
                <p><b>I also like learning stuff like physics, computer science, programming, etc. I like to play video games a lot as well. I'm not very skilled in terms of social situations, but I think nowadays that's the case with a lot of people. I am also a developer, although I consider myself average, as I don't really have much of the time to practice so I try to practice during the weekend. I mostly specialise in cybersecurity, networking, web development, and also I've been getting into AI and robotics as well.</b></p>
                <p><b>In terms of what I plan to do, I really want to pursue a career in programming or IT. That's why I'm trying to get more practice and to develop my skills. I currently plan to do computer science in college/university, although I do try to learn a lot of Computer Science at home. I probably would like to be an entrepreneur but that would be a bit too ambitious. I would like to be able make a good imapact on the world as well.</b></p>
                <p><b>I do find that I enjoy doing a lot of my learning at home. I don't really like the current education system as I find it to be more like a factory line. I also plan to gain IT certifications and other certs possibly to supplement my exerience, knowledge and skills</b></p>
                <p>The above profile should sum everything up hopefully. I'll be updating this every few months so yeah, it will likely change a bit.</p>
                <h2>My qualifications</h2>
                <p>Under this qualifications heading, I will be giving a profile like I did in the previous heading, except it's more professional and may function a bit like a resume. The professional  profile as well as my <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a> will be used to hopefully function as a way to present myself in more of a professional way. It will mainly be used to help showcase my skills and so people know my qualifications. My "professional profile" probably sounds to have a goofy name, but I will just go with it for now.</p>
                <h3>Professional Profile</h3>
                <ul>
                <li>Name/Alias: <b>The Dark Diamond</b></li>
                <li>Age: <b>15</b></li>
                <li>MBTI: <b>INTP-T(I decided to put this here because mine was fairly accurate for me, but I don't think MBTI is 100% accurate because a personality has more than 4 personality traits)</b></li>
                <li>Country of origin: <b>Ireland</b></li>
                <li>Occupation: <b>Student</b></li>
                <li>Education level: <b>Currently in 9th grade</b></li>
                <li>Industries of qualification: <b>Software engineering, data science and AI, android app development(Kotlin), networking, IT and security. Main ones are Android app development, data science and AI, software engineering, and security</b></li>
                <li>Qualifications/certifications: <b>None. Currently going toward the freecodecamp cirriculum certifications, as well as ones from Coursera courses and CS50. Considering the CompTIA A+ and Network+, althould I'll probably consider these once I graduate and begin in college/university.</b></li>
                <li>Skills: <b>Programming(average), IT(intermediate), problem-solving(intermediate), social skills(a little bit below average), work ethic(average), data science(beginner), networking(beginner), security(average)</b></li>
                <li>Bio: <b>I'm The Dark Diamond. I have been into programming and IT since I was 12. I began with web development. When I became 13, I took a little break, but then began to continue developing my skills starting at age 14. I procrasinated a bit and am now trying to improve the skills I have as much as I can.</b></li>
                <p><b>You can check out my portfolio, although it does not have much on it as I haven't had that much time due to school. My current plans are to go to college and pursue a computer science degree and I'll also pursue it self-taught. Although I don't personally go forward with college 100%, as there's no guarantee college is up-to-date with our innovative world, but computer science may be the most promising, so I'll decide to go with it.</b></p>
                <p><b>Now to say what my best skills are, it's probably an ability to adapt and learn, put in the effort when I genuinely enjoy the thing, gain and improve different skills and learn more, and my ability to think a bit outside the box.</b></p>
                <p><b>However, I am not going to make myself look like I do not have flaws. Like all people, I have flaws, so I might as well tell them in this paragraph. My main flaws are poor social skills, procrasination, difficulty with deadlines, procrasination.</b></p>
            </ul>
            <p>The above profile should hopefully be a good description. I will try to update the profiles as much as I can to keep up-to-date with myself, my skills and my qualifications. If you have any questions, feel free to email me at thedarkdiamond24@gmail.com.</p>
            <h2>Purpose of this website</h2>
            <p>This might be shorter than the other parts of this about page, but I will just write this part anyway.</p>
            <p>I made this website as a way to improve my skills in web development (HTML and CSS). I got the idea to build this website about a year ago. I had a few websites before, but I ended up deleting them as they weren't worth it, but one day I was taking a course on web development when I was 14, and I had the idea again to build a website. Except this time, I decided to write down my ideas for it. My main idea for it was a blog. So I decided to just do it, I spent a small amount of time developing the page, and I decided to host the website, under a free hosting provider of course. I began to work more on the site and now we are at todat, where this site is still pretty mediocre, but I have actually enjoyed working on this site, as it's my way to reach out to people and the world. It is also something I can work on when I'm bored and whatnot as there is still so much that I can put on this website. Plus, this website will help me to imrove my programming skills.</p>
            <p>Sorry for making this part a bit long, but I think it's okay. I will be updating this page every few months to keep up-to-date with myself. So feel free to check on here anytime.</p>
