                <h1>Welcome</h1>
                <p>Hello and welcome to my website. I have experience in web development as I've been doing since I was 12. I gave made a couple of websites in the past but I just didn't have the time or energy to put effort into them, so they kinda just sat there with no use really until I just decided to delte the website.</p>
                <p>However, this time I decided to put a bit more effort into this website. I plan to keep this website updated and use it as much as I can. I think it would also be a good thing for me to have to practice my coding skills as well as how I present content.</p>
                <p>If you have any questions or suggestions, you can feel free to email me at thedarkdiamond24@gmail.com. I'll try to respond as soon as I can. As I am trying to best to improve this website as I particularly plan to use it as a way for a blog as that's a place from which I can voice my opinions, talk about random topics, etc. If you're interested in the <a href="blog.html">blog</a>, feel free to check it out, as that's the page that I update the most on this website.</p>
